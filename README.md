# Fluorescence image of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast(MEF)

These images are for Nature Protocol Paper: 
*A robust unsupervised machine learning   method to quantify the morphological heterogeneity of cells and nuclei* 

MEF cells are seeded on Circle and Triangle micropattern coated with Fibronectin. Control group cells are seeded on cell culture surface without any micropattern.

Exact method of micropatterning is described in this paper:
